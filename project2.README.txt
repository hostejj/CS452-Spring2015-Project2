Interaction:

This project features a chess board with some missing squares and a piece placed on it.
The squares a missing for an unknown reason that I think is related to have too long of a buffer or array.

The piece on the board can be moved using the WASD keys in different directions.
The view of the board can be changed by using the arrow keys.
